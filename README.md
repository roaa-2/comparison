Thalassemia refers to a group of genetic disorders in which there is an imbalance between α-globin and β-globin chain production. Ineffective erythropoiesis is the hallmark leading to anemia, erythroid hyperplasia, and increased absorption of iron from the gut.1 The combination of hemolysis, increased iron absorption, and repeated blood transfusions culminate in a state of iron overload. Myocardial iron deposition is a significant problem and major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients.2 Monotherapy and combination chelation therapy have been used to reduce iron deposition in different organs.3 However, these measures may be insufficient to remove iron deposits in the tissues, especially in the heart. In vitro studies have demonstrated the role of L-type (LTCC) and T-type calcium channel (TTCC) blockers in uptake of iron by cardiomyocytes and reduction of myocardial iron overload by LTCC (nifedipine, amlodipine, verapamil) and TTCCblockers (efonidipine).4,5 Apilot study carried out in patients with thalassemia major reported a significant reduction in serum ferritin levels with the use of amlodipine in conjunction with standard chelation therapy.6 There are studies from India that have used combination chelation therapy in patients with thalassemia major, but none in combination with amlodipine.7,8 A double-blind placebo-controlled trial was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, in addition to standard chelation therapy in reducing iron levels in patientswith thalassemia major. The primary outcome of the study was change in myocardial iron concentration (MIC) at 12 months from baseline as defined by T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) values. Secondary outcomes were change in liver iron concentration (LIC) at 12 months as defined by T2*MRI values, change in serum ferritin levels at 6 and 12 months, change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 12 months from baseline, and adverse events at the initiation of study and 3, 6, and 12 months.
2 PATIENTS AND METHODS 2.2
This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was carried out in the thalassemia unit of the division of pediatric hematology oncology, department of pediatrics in collaboration with the department of radiodiagnosis and imaging and department of cardiology of a university teaching hospital in north India from June 2019 to October 2020. Study was approved by institute ethics committee. The study was registered with Central Trial Registry of India (CTRI) CTRI/2019/06/019787. Objective of the study was to assess the effect of amlodipine, LTCC blocker, in addition to the standard chelation therapy in reducing myocardial iron overload in patients with thalassemia major. We hypothesized that amlodipine plus chelation therapy is more efficacious than chelation therapy alone in reducing myocardial iron deposition in patients with thalassemia with iron overload. Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) registered in the thalassemia unit were enrolled for the trial. Inclusion
2.2.1 Intervention Intervention group (group A)
Children in this group received regular iron chelation and amlodipine (5 mg/day for ≥30 kg bodyweight and 2.5 mg/day for <30 kg bodyweight).
2.2.2 Control group (group B) Children in this group received regular iron chelation and placebo. 2.3 Data collection
Eligible patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were recruited over a period of 6 months. Recruitment was done among
criteria were patients in the age group of 6–20 years with serum ferritin >1000 ng/ml, history of having received ≥10 transfusions, and being on stable chelation for >6 months. Exclusion criteria were patients with known congenital or acquired heart disease (valvular, cardiomyopathy), or significant renal disease (serum creatinine more than three times normal/estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 ml/min/m2) or having hepatic disease (alanine transferase [ALT]/aspartate transferase [AST] more than three times upper limit of normal), or cardiac T2* value <4 milliseconds, and not willing to giving written informed consent.
2.1 Calculation of sample size
In a pilot study done on 16 patients with thalassemia major where myocardial T2* value was estimated, T2* value of<20 millisecondswas observed in seven(43.8%)patients, implying increasedmyocardial iron. Remaining nine (56.2%) patients had myocardial T2* ≥20 seconds.We hypothesized that there would be 50% reduction in the incidence of myocardial iron overload with the use of intended drug (amlodipine) in the intervention arm. Using a one-sided test for two proportions, with α error of 5%,
power of study 80%, and level of confidence 95%, the sample size was calculated as 64. With a dropout rate of 5%, the final proposed sample size was 68. In 1:1 ratio, 34 patients were planned to be randomized into each arm.
2.1.1 Randomization
Children fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomized to one of the two groups (intervention vs. control group) using computer-generated randomization tables. The randomization sequence was prepared by an independent person. Allocation of children was done using serially numbered opaque and sealed envelopes.

amlodipine group. However, there was no significant change observed in patients in control group. This observation is in accordance with a recent study, where a significant improvement was observed in myocardial T2* from 40.63 ± 5.45 milliseconds at baseline to 43.25 ± 5.35 milliseconds after 6 months in patients treatedwith amlodipine.16 The relative improvement of myocardial T2* in the patients who received amlodipine was also consistent with a randomized controlled trial, which indicated that myocardial T2* changed significantly after 1 year of treatment, from 21.9 ± 8.0 to 24.5 ± 7.6 milliseconds.17 Significant reduction in MIC in amlodipine-treated group (1.93 ± 1.61 at baseline to 1.29 ± 0.90 after 12 months) in our study was also similar to the observations of two previous studies.13,16 In an early pilot study carried out on 15 patients, it was observed
that myocardial T2* increased significantly in comparison to baseline at 6 and 12 months (21.7 ± 7.2 to 28.2 ± 7.9 and 28.3 ± 8.0 milliseconds, with p = .007 and .03, respectively) in amlodipine-treated group, whereas no differences were observed in the control group (25.1 ± 8.8 to 24.7 ± 7.8 and 26.2 ± 11.4 milliseconds, p = .99 and .95, respectively).6 Significant differences between groups were also observed at 6 months (28.2 ± 7.9 vs. 24.7 ± 7.8 milliseconds in the control group, p = .03). However, the difference was not significant at 12 months. No significant change was noted in LIC in both amlodipine group
and placebo group after 12 months of treatment in the present study. This can be explained by the fact that iron deposition in the liver tissues does not depend on active uptake by voltage-gated calcium channels; therefore, blocking or opening the calcium channels would not affect the iron uptake into hepatocytes. This is in accordance with the earlier studies.6,16,17 Second, we have used signal-intensity ratios on gradient echo images to determine LIC, which has not been validated in
